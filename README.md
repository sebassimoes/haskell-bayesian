# haskell-bayesian

Haskell library for representation of *bayesian networks*, supporting different inference algorithms.

## Building and testing

Project dependency management, build and testing is done using [Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#the-haskell-tool-stack). 

## Simple stack commands examples 

* Building the library
  `stack build`

* Running all test suites
  `stack test haskell-bayesian`

* Running a specific test suite
  `stack test haskell-bayesian:factors-test`
